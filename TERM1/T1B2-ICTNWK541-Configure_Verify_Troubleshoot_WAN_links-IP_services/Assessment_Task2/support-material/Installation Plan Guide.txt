The installation plan should be a detailed roadmap with clear steps in order of priority. 

An installation plan could include:

●	step by step procedures to be used for installation

●	vendor documentation, guidelines, instructions, and Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

●	connection requirements

●	configurations for WAN

●	protocols for WAN

●	configurations for virtual private network (VPN)

●	configuration of ADSL connection

●	Dynamic Host Configuration Protocols (DHCP) for router operation

●	configuration of internet protocol version 6 (IPv6) addressing

●	configuration of the network address translation (NAT) requirements 

●	the purpose and types of access control lists (ACLs)

●	configuring ACLs according to network filtering requirements

●	securing access to the network router


●	organisational policies and procedures that must be followed
●	reference to contingency plans.

When developing an installation plan, you could use standard organisational templates and you may need to consult with others in the workplace to get their input with regards to the plan.
