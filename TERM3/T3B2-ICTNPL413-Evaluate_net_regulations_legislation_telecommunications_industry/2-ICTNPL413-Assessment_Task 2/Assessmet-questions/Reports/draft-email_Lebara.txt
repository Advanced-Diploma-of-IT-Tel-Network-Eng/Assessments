Dear CEO of Lebara,

I am writing to share the results of the research conducted at my college. The report is a comprehensive report that evaluates the economic and political influences on the Australian networking industry and the impact of regulations and legislation on Lebara. I also outlined some recommendations that Lebara could implement regarding three of the most critical and publicly controversial aspects: Pricing Strategy, Customer Engagement and Trust, and Market Positioning.

In addition, please find attached a summary report that analyses the Australian regulatory framework and its impact on Lebara's network service planning and accessibility, where I highlight the excellent work being done with customer service, especially the helplines and the interpreter service.

I hope you find my recommendations useful and that my research helps you improve Lebara's policies.

Sincerely,
Manuel Perez
