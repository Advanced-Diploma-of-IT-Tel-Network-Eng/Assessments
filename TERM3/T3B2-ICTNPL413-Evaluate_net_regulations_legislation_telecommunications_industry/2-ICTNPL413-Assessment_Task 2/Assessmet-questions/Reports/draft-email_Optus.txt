Dear CEO of Optus,

I am contacting you to share the results of the research conducted at my college. The report is a comprehensive report that evaluates the economic and political influences on the Australian networking industry and the impact of regulations and legislation for Optus. I also outlined some recommendations that Optus could implement regarding three of the most critical and publicly controversial aspects: network investment, market competition, and data security and cyber resilience.

Additionally, please find attached a summary report that analyses the Australian regulatory framework and its impact on Optus' network service planning and accessibility, where I highlight the great work being done with the Access and Inclusion Action Plan.

I hope you find my recommendations useful and that my research helps you improve Optus policies.

Sincerely,
Manuel Perez
