Subject: Request for Approval – Cloud-First SaaS & B2C Strategic Initiative

To: Senior Management and Founders,

CCC: Divya Sapra


Dear Senior Management and Founders,

I am writing to formally request approval of the proposed Cloud-First SaaS and B2C Model as a strategic response to the current operational and financial challenges facing Worlducation.

As expected, based on revised financial projections for 2020, it is clear that the organization is experiencing a mismatch between growing market demand and its current manufacturing and supply chain capacity. Continued reliance on physical manufacturing has exposed the company to supply chain disruptions, increased operating costs, reduced profitability, and negative cash flow.


Based on existing information and feedback received, we have developed this proposal. This approach promotes service continuity, enhances supply chain resilience, and enables the organization to efficiently scale to meet growing demand without additional manufacturing constraints.

From a strategic perspective, this solution aligns with Worlducation's priorities of improving performance, profitability, accountability, and long-term sustainability. It also supports the organization's mission to expand access to education by broadening market reach beyond traditional school models.


Key risks, such as career transition, financial sustainability, and cybersecurity, have been strategically identified and acknowledged. These risks will be managed through appropriate governance, planning, and phased decision-making in subsequent stages, should approval be granted.

Therefore, I hereby request approval to implement this solution. This will allow for more detailed planning and assessment, in accordance with the organization's policies and legal requirements.


Please let me know if you require any additional information to support this decision.

Kind regards,
Manuel Perez
