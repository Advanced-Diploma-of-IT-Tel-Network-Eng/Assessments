Activity:

Scenario:
I work in a warehouse, where we have a break every two hours. Each time we start and finish our break, we have to sign in and sign out.

Issue:
Do not sign in and sign off may cause payment delays

Root cause:
1. I usually forget to sign in and sign off
2. The app crashes and does not record the session
3. There are no communication channels to remind us

Solution:
1. Send reminders to all walkie-talkies
2. Automate the process using RFID Tags
